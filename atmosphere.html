    <p>The Atmosphere License is an open source software license with fossil fuel divestment provisions. It complies
        with
        the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition</a> and the <a
            href="https://ethicalsource.dev/definition/">Ethical Source Definition</a>, and it's designed to impose
        quantifiable, enforceable obligations. Anyone, and any organization, can qualify to use and to convey programs
        under the Atmosphere License, and there are no limits on the content or functionality of the licensed programs.
    </p>
    <p>The Atmosphere License incorporates many provisions of the <a
            href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU General Public License</a>, it optionally
        incorporates the concept of "deforestation" from the <a href="https://github.com/raisely/NoHarm">Do No Harm
            License</a>, and it also incorporates the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.md">GNU Affero
            GPL's</a> concept of "Remote Network Interaction" as a trigger for license compliance. However, the
        Atmosphere
        License is not a version of any of those licenses.</p>
    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    <p>Software developers cannot ignore the impact of networked computation on the global climate crisis. The energy
        demands of the global economy far exceed the current production of renewable energy. While software development
        has
        the potential to make economic activity far more efficient, fossil fuel's high subsidies and disastrous social
        costs
        mean that improvements to software often give their users the ability to optimize for financial profit at the
        expense of the environment, by increasing their fossil fuel extraction and polluting activities. This dynamic
        has
        been worsened by the rise of cryptocurrency, which has made it possible to monetize computation roughly in
        proportion to the amount of energy consumed. Computation, energy, economics, and ecology are now locked in a
        harmful
        cycle. The purpose of the Atmosphere License is to let developers push back against this cycle, supporting
        environmental sustainabiliy by creating code that increases the relative economic value of renewable energy.</p>
    <p>Developers often release their software under open licenses out of a charitable impulse to help users accomplish
        their tasks more easily. The Atmosphere License acknowledges that if a contribution to open source helps its
        users
        to worsen the climate crisis and endanger the ecosystem that everyone depends on to survive, then the
        contribution
        is not effective altruism. The pursuit of open source software users' freedom must respect the physical safety
        of
        all stakeholders, including the users and the developers themselves.</p>
    <p class="ðŸ›‚">Some opponents of environmental sustainability justify the rapid destruction of natural resources and
        human
        habitat
        as an opportunity to use the victims' status as displaced people or refugees as a pretense to drastically reduce
        the
        victims' human rights and freedom of movement. By trying to shift the burden of ecological collapse onto others,
        they seek to avoid the real challenge of stabilizing the climate. Because these two issues are linked, this
        version
        of the Atmosphere License also requires divestment from enterprises that target minority groups or refugees for
        imprisonment or violence.</p>
    <p class="ðŸ’¸">This version of the Atmosphere License also requires divestment from enterprises that operate
        for-profit prisons.
    </p>
    <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
    <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
    <h3>0. Scope</h3>
    <p>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
        it
        may be distributed under the terms of this Atmosphere License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program
        or
        work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
        that is
        to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
        translated
        into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
        Each
        licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
    <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside
        its
        scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
        contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
        Whether
        that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
    <h3>1. Verbatim Copies</h3>
    <p>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
        provided
        that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
        warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give
        any
        other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
    <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
        protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
    <h3>2. Modified Copies</h3>
    <p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
        and
        copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that each time you
        do so
        you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date
            of
            any change.</li>
        <li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from
            the
            Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
            this
            License.</li>
        <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
            running
            for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
            appropriate
            copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
            that
            users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
            License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
            your
            work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</li>
        <li>You must divest from all Disqualifying Assets as listed in Section 3.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, when you modify the Program, you may allow users to interact
        with your modified version remotely through a computer network only if you have divested from all Disqualifying
        Assets as listed in Section 3, and your modified version of the Program must prominently offer all users
        interacting
        with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to
        receive
        the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server
        at no
        charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.</p>
    <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
        from
        the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
        and
        its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute
        the
        same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
        the
        terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and
        every
        part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
    <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
        you;
        rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based
        on
        the Program.</p>
    <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
        the
        Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
        License.</p>
    <h3>3. Divestment</h3>
    <p>"Divestment" of an asset means relinquishing all ownership interest in the asset, all profit rights in the asset,
        or
        right to control the asset, through sale or other disposal of the asset, or placing the asset under a
        conservation
        easement or other effective legal restriction, valid for at least three years, barring use of the asset for the
        activities that caused it to qualify as a "Disqualifying Asset".</p>
    <p>"Disqualifying Assets" subject to Divestment under the terms of this License include "Disqualifying Investments"
        and
        "Disqualifying Facilities".</p>
    <p>A "Disqualifying Investment" is any investment exceeding $10,000 in value in a company, agency, or entity that
        operates any Disqualifying Facility or has a majority ownership interest or majority profit rights in any
        Disqualifying Facility. A Disqualifying Investment may take the form of direct ownership, shares, commingled
        mutual
        funds containing shares, or corporate bonds.</p>
    <p>"Disqualifying Facilities" include any of the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>any coal mine or any coal extraction operations.</li>
        <li>any oil or natural gas wells or extraction operations.</li>
        <li>any coal, oil, or natural gas processing facility.</li>
        <li>any pipeline longer than 10 kilometers used for fossil fuel transportation.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="ðŸŒ³">3ðŸŒ³. Deforestation</h4>
    <p class="ðŸŒ³">"Disqualifying Facilities" also include any of the following:</p>
    <ol class="ðŸŒ³">
        <li>any deforestation operation.<ul>
                <li>"Deforestation" shall mean the clearing, burning, or destruction of 0.5 or more hectares of forests
                    within a 1 year period for conversion to a non-forest use such as farming, ranching, or
                    construction.
                </li>
                <li>"Forest" shall mean 0.5 or more hectares of trees that were either planted more than 50 years ago or
                    were not planted by humans or human made equipment.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>any land that has been deforested within the past three years.<ul>
                <li>a "conservation easement or other effective legal restriction" on land that has been deforested only
                    qualifies as "Divestment" if it effectively prohibits all non-forest use.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="ðŸ›‚">3ðŸ›‚. Civilian Internment</h4>
    <p class="ðŸ›‚">"Disqualifying Facilities" also include any of the following:</p>
    <ol class="ðŸ›‚">
        <li>any concentration camp or other facility for involuntary internment of civilians based on their status as
            refugees (including climate refugees), status as asylum claimants, race, ethnicity, religion, national
            origin,
            sexual orientation, gender, or gender identification.</li>
        <li>any business, agency, or entity engaged in any of the five offenses defined by Article 3 of the United
            Nations
            Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="ðŸ’¸">3ðŸ’¸. For-Profit Prisons</h4>
    <p class="ðŸ’¸">"Disqualifying Facilities" also include any prison or jail that is owned or operated for a profit.</p>
    <h3>4. Source Code</h3>
    <p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
        form
        under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
            the
            terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</li>
        <li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no
            more
            than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
            corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
            customarily
            used for software interchange; or,</li>
        <li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
            (This
            alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
            code
            or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
            The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
            executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
            associated
            interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
            However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
            distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
            operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
        offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
        code,
        even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
    <h3>5. Termination</h3>
    <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.
        Any
        attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
        terminate
        your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
        License
        will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
    <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is
        reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
        license,
        and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior
        to
        60 days after the cessation.</p>
    <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder
        notifies
        you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of
        this
        License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
        receipt of
        the notice.</p>
    <h3>6. Acceptance</h3>
    <p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
        permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if
        you
        do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
        Program),
        you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or
        modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
    <h3>7. Additional Terms</h3>
    <p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
        license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
        conditions.
    </p>
    <p>If the original license omitted any of the optional provisions regarding Deforestation, Civilian Internment, or
        For-Profit Prisons, you may add one or more of those provisions to the license as additional terms when
        conveying
        modified versions of the Program.</p>
    <p>You may also subject parts of the Program to restrictions derived from the Apache License Version 2.0, regarding
        matters such as patent termination and indemnification, if those parts of the Program were previously licensed
        under
        the Apache License. This is necessary to stay in compliance with the Apache License when relicensing under the
        Atmosphere License. To do this, add the phrase "subject to restrictions in Apache License Version 2.0" to the
        boilerplate Atmosphere License notices for your Program, or for the files or other parts of the Program that
        were
        covered by the Apache License.</p>
    <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
        responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
    <h3>8. Inconsistent Conditions</h3>
    <p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
        limited to
        patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict
        the
        conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
        so
        as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
        consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
        royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
        then
        the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
        Program.</p>
    <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
        the
        section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
    <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
        contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
        and
        ethical software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. An author/donor
        distributes
        software through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor
        to
        decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
        choice.</p>
    <h3>9. Permission from Authors</h3>
    <p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other programs whose distribution conditions are different,
        or
        if you wish to distribute modified versions of the Program or offer users Remote Network Interaction with a
        modified
        version of the Program without divesting from Disqualifying Assets, write to the author(s) to ask for permission
        to
        do so under the terms of a different license.</p>
    <h3>10. No Warranty</h3>
    <p>Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by
        applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the
        program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
        implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality
        and
        performance of the program is with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary
        servicing, repair or correction.</p>
    <h3>11. No Liability</h3>
    <p>In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other
        party
        who may modify and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any
        general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program
        (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third
        parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has
        been
        advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
    <h2>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
    <h3>How to apply the Atmosphere License to your work</h3>
    <p>Attach the following boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
        identifying
        information. If you want to include any optional provisions in your license, include the emojis corresponding to
        those provisions at the end of your license version number.</p>
    <p>Copyright [YEAR] [COPYRIGHT HOLDER]
        Atmosphere Software License Version 0.1<span class="any-options">â€“</span><span class="ðŸŒ³">ðŸŒ³</span><span
            class="ðŸ›‚">ðŸ›‚</span><span class="ðŸ’¸">ðŸ’¸</span></p>
    <p>If your program has an interactive mode, you should have it provide the name and version number of the Atmosphere
        License when it starts up, and provide a link to where the full license can be found.</p>
    <p>If you're including any optional provisions, make sure they appear at the end of Section 3 ("Divestment"). If
        you're
        working from a template, be sure that you've removed the brackets from around the provisions you want to use and
        removed the word "OPTIONAL" before them, both in the version number and in the license text. Be sure to delete
        any
        optional provisions you don't want to use. If you make a mistake that causes the license to be ambiguous, an
        optional provision is considered to be included in your license if and only if its text appears in the license
        without the word "OPTIONAL".</p>
