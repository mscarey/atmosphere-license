<h1>Open Austin Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>Open Austin is committed to broad community participation, and making our events enjoyable and rewarding for everybody who participates. We provide this Code of Conduct In the interest of facilitating a positive, nurturing experience for all.</p>
<p>We expect participants at our events and activities to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep a safe and respectful environment for all other participants.</li>
<li>Act to ensure other participants are free to fully express their identities.</li>
<li>Recognize that participants have different backgrounds and levels of experience. Everybody should be welcome, questions encouraged, and mentoring opportunities sought.</li>
<li>Bring positive efforts and skills to bear, and prefer language such as “yes/and” to “no/but.”</li>
<li>Strive to listen as much as they speak.</li>
<li>Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Support efforts to prioritize activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain.</li>
<li>Support efforts to prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.</li>
<li>Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.</li>
<li>Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.</li>
<li>Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.</li>
<li>Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Event organizers reserve the right to take action, up to and including expulsion, in response to violations of these policies.</p>
<p>We will lend our name and support only to events and activities conducted under a code of conduct that is substantially similar to this.</p>
