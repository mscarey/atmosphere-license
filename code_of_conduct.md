# Open Austin Code of Conduct
Open Austin is committed to broad community participation, and making our events enjoyable and rewarding for everybody who participates. We provide this Code of Conduct In the interest of facilitating a positive, nurturing experience for all.

We expect participants at our events and activities to:

1.  Keep a safe and respectful environment for all other participants.
2.  Act to ensure other participants are free to fully express their identities.
3.  Recognize that participants have different backgrounds and levels of experience. Everybody should be welcome, questions encouraged, and mentoring opportunities sought.
4.  Bring positive efforts and skills to bear, and prefer language such as “yes/and” to “no/but.”
5.  Strive to listen as much as they speak.
6.  Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Support efforts to prioritize activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain.
7.  Support efforts to prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
8.  Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
9.  Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
10.  Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
11.  Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.

Event organizers reserve the right to take action, up to and including expulsion, in response to violations of these policies.

We will lend our name and support only to events and activities conducted under a code of conduct that is substantially similar to this.
